        Tibetan Spaniels, or Tibbies as they are sometimes called, are some fun, small dogs. Very intelligent and independent, very much like cats. They don't take orders from their owners unless it suits them.</p>
      <p>Originally from the Himalayan Mountains in Tibet, this is an over 2500 years old breed. They used to live in monasteries here and function both as watchdogs and as bedwarmers.</p>
      <p>You can still see this in them as they love to sit in windows and gaze out at the world. They also love soft fluffy beds.</p>
      <p>The breed came to the west in the 1890's, and called "spaniels" due to their resemblence to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</p>
